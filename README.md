### Abstract: 
The presence of offensive comments on social media has become a major issue in the use of the Internet. Natural Language Processing area has been studying methods and tools for the automatic detection of such content in social networks. The MeOffendEs task in the IberLEF evaluation campaign opened this problem to the research community for the Spanish language. This paper studies two methods for integrating certain contextual information with several transformer-based models. Our findings suggest that the contextual information provided by organizers does not contribute to a better prediction power. Instead, hyper-parameter search is a very important step in the general learning process, leading to systems outperforming the state-of-the-art in Spanish offensiveness detection.

    abstract = "Offensive language detection and analysis has become a major area of research in Natural Language Processing. The freedom of participation in social media has exposed online users to posts designed to denigrate, insult or hurt them according to gender, race, religion, ideology, or other personal characteristics. Focusing on young influencers from the well-known social platforms of Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube, we have collected a corpus composed of 47,128 Spanish comments manually labeled on offensive pre-defined categories. A subset of the corpus attaches a degree of confidence to each label, so both multi-class classification and multi-output regression studies are possible. In this paper, we introduce the corpus, discuss its building process, novelties, and some preliminary experiments with it to serve as a baseline for the research community."
